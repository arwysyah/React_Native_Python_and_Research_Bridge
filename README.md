React Native Bridge 


How To Install
yarn install (to install node modules)
probably you wont get local.properties  so you can create by copy from your another project

if you get unlicensed chaquopy .... , it because because it used restricted version ,you can copy ``chaquopy.license=free`` in local.properties to run fully chaquopy
but it download all python package and make this project bigger , so if you just want to test this library ,no need to install fully chaquopy
